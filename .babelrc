// NOTE: These options are overriden by the babel-loader configuration
// for webpack, which can be found in ~/build/webpack.config.
//
// Why? The react-transform-hmr plugin depends on HMR (and throws if
// module.hot is disabled), so keeping it and related plugins contained
// within webpack helps prevent unexpected errors.
//
// Keeping the options in the build process (webpck) configuration is wise
// simpply because it isnâ€™t unheard of to want different configuration for
// tests, task runners, etc.
